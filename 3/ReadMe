To be able to use the application you need to have at least "mysql-connector-java-5.0.8".

You also need to run the script <files.sql> to set up the database with the table structure, or create your own database that does the same thing.

You also need to change the following variables to match your setup!

private final String DATASOURCE = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/files";
private final String connectUser = "CHANGE THIS TO YOUR USERNAME TO ACCESS THE DATABASE";
private final String connectPass = "CHANGE THIS TO YOUR PASSWORD TO ACCESS THE DATABASE";
